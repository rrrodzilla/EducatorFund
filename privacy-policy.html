    <h1>Educator Fund - Privacy Policy</h1>


    <p>At EducatorFund, we value our community. You trust us with your information, and we&rsquo;re serious about that
        responsibility. We believe in transparency, and we&rsquo;re committed to being upfront about our privacy
        practices, including how we treat personal information we collect or receive. We know you care about your
        privacy, too, so we provide settings that allow you to control how certain information is used on EducatorFund.
        This policy explains our privacy practices for EducatorFund.com (the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;), EducatorFund&rsquo;s
        mobile application (the &ldquo;App&rdquo;) and services provided by Neyborly Company (collectively,
        &ldquo;EducatorFund&rdquo;). By visiting the Site or using the App, you are accepting the terms of this Privacy
        Policy. Any external links to other websites are clearly identifiable as such, and we are not responsible for
        the content or the privacy policies of these other websites.</p>

    <p>Current version published: November 4, 2018&nbsp;</p>

    <h2>Information Collected or Received</h2>

    <p>EducatorFund will not disclose your name, email address or other personal information to third parties without
        your explicit consent, except as specified in this policy.</p>

    <p>As an EducatorFund member, you are required to provide a valid email address at registration and choose a
        username or alias that may represent your identity on EducatorFund.</p>

    <p>Depending on which services you choose to use, EducatorFund may require additional information, such as a class
        and/or school name, billing and payment information (including billing address, telephone number, credit card
        information), a telephone number, and/or a physical postal address. As an educator, if you choose to receive
        payouts, EducatorFund may require information such as your social security number, identification ID or tax ID,
        date of birth, bank account information, credit card information and/or other proof of identification in order
        to verify your identity and provide this service to you. Credit card information on an account may be stored
        and used for both billing and payment purposes. EducatorFund may contact individual educators to confidentially
        request more information about their classes or items listed on the App, to ensure compliance with our rules.
        Certain products or services on EducatorFund may require you to complete an application; any information you
        submit through the application processes will not be displayed publicly and will only be used internally by
        EducatorFund unless otherwise specified.</p>

    <p>You may optionally choose to provide your full name and other personal information (such as birthday, gender,
        location) to be publicly displayed in connection with your account and activity.</p>

    <p>Your username, EducatorFund ID or alias is publicly displayed and connected to your EducatorFund activity. Other
        people may see your date joined, reviews, ratings, profile information, classes listed and comments in
        community spaces.</p>

    <p>EducatorFund automatically receives and records some information from your browser or your mobile device when
        you visit the Site or use the App, such as your IP address or unique device identifier, cookies and data about
        which pages you visit on the Site or on the Apps. This information helps us analyze and understand how the Site
        and the App work for members and visitors, and provide a more personalized experience for members and visitors.</p>

    <p>EducatorFund uses the information described in this policy to provide and improve our services and products, for
        billing and payments, for identification and authentication purposes, to contact members or interested parties,
        and for general research and aggregate reporting.</p>

    <p>EducatorFund&rsquo;s <a href="./tos.html">Terms of Use</a> require all account owners to be at least 18 years of
        age (or have the permission and supervision of a responsible parent or legal guardian), therefore, this policy
        does not discuss the use of our Site, our Apps, or services by minors.</p>

    <h2>Choice &amp; Control</h2>

    <p>We know members of our community value having control over their own information, and therefore EducatorFund
        gives you the choice of providing, editing or removing certain information, as well as the choice over how we
        contact you.</p>

    <p>You may change or correct your EducatorFund account information (except your username) on the App. You may also
        remove certain optional information on the App that you no longer wish to be publicly visible, such as your
        full name.</p>

    <p>For various reasons, EducatorFund may contact you about our services or your activity. Some of these messages
        are required, service-related messages for members. Other messages are not required, and you can control which
        optional messages you choose to receive by changing your settings in your account. Learn more in the <em>Messages
            from EducatorFund</em> section of this policy.</p>

    <p>If you have optionally connected your account to an external, third-party application, such as Facebook, or an
        app developed using the EducatorFund API, you can remove permission for the app by changing your account
        settings.</p>

    <p>If you no longer wish to use EducatorFund&rsquo;s services or receive service-related messages, then you may
        close your account. Contact support@educatorfund.com to cancel your account.</p>

    <h2>Messages from EducatorFund</h2>

    <p>On occasion, EducatorFund will contact you. Primarily, messages are delivered by email or by text message, and
        every account is required to keep a valid email address on file to receive messages. In some situations,
        EducatorFund may contact you by telephone, SMS message or physical mail in order to provide you with customer
        support or to provide you with information about products and features you may find of interest. You may update
        your contact preferences in your Stripe account settings.</p>

    <p>Some messages from EducatorFund are service-related and required for members. Examples of service-related
        messages include, but are not limited to: a welcome/confirmation email when you register your account,
        notification of an order, or correspondence with EducatorFund&rsquo;s support team. These messages are not
        promotional in nature. You may not opt-out of receiving service-related messages from EducatorFund unless you
        close your account.</p>

    <p>As a member, EducatorFund may also send you messages related to certain features or your activity on the Site or
        App. EducatorFund may also send you news or updates about changes to our Site, App, or services. By default,
        members will receive these messages via email or text messages through the App.</p>

    <p>Information Sharing &amp; Disclosure</p>

    <p>We want to respect your privacy. EducatorFund will not disclose your name, email address or other personal
        information to third parties without your explicit consent, except as specified in this policy.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>EducatorFund limits access to your personal information to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into
        contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>EducatorFund may release your personal information to a third-party in order to comply with a subpoena or other
        legal requirement, or when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law;
        prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss; or investigate or take action regarding illegal activities,
        suspected fraud, or violations of EducatorFund's <a href="./tos.html">Terms of Use</a>.
        We may disclose personally identifiable information to parties, as we in our sole discretion believe necessary
        or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or
        other unlawful activity. In such events, EducatorFund may disclose a name, address, country, phone number,
        email address and company name.</p>

    <p>EducatorFund employs other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf, and we need to share your
        information with them to provide products and services to you. Examples include but are not limited to
        fulfilling orders, processing payments, handling billing disputes and collections, analyzing data, providing
        mapping services, preventing fraud, improving performance and stability of the App, providing marketing
        assistance and providing customer service. EducatorFund may partner with third-party services for fraud
        prevention and/or identity verification.</p>

    <p>In some cases, EducatorFund may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, member information
        is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. EducatorFund will transfer information about you
        if EducatorFund is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, EducatorFund will notify you by
        email or by putting a prominent notice on the Site and the App before information about you is transferred and
        becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

    <p>When you a load a page on EducatorFund that has a social plug-in from a third-party site or service, such as a
        Like or Send button, you are also loading content from that third-party site. That site may request cookies
        directly from your browser. These interactions are subject to the privacy policy of the third-party site.</p>

    <p>We can only speak for ourselves; this policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that EducatorFund
        does not own or control or individuals that EducatorFund does not employ or manage. If you provide your
        information to others on EducatorFund or throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to the use or
        disclosure of the information you provide to them. EducatorFund does not control the privacy policies of third
        parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. EducatorFund is
        not responsible for the privacy or security practices of other websites on the Internet, even those linked to
        or from the&nbsp; EducatorFund Site or App. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal
        information to others.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>We reserve the right to transfer information (including your personal data) to a third party in the event of a
        sale, merger, liquidation, receivership or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of our company
        provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of our Privacy Policy and provided that the third
        party only uses your personal data for the purposes that you provided it to us. You will be notified in the
        event of any such transfer and you will be afforded an opportunity to opt-out.</p>

    <h2>Cookies &amp; Tracking Technologies</h2>

    <p>EducatorFund uses a variety of technologies to help us better understand how people use our Site, App, and
        services.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>EducatorFund may partner with third-party services who may use various tracking technologies, such as browser
        cookies or Flash cookies, to provide certain services or features. These technologies allow a partner to
        recognize your computer or mobile device each time you visit EducatorFund but do not allow access to personally
        identifiable information from EducatorFund. EducatorFund does not have access or control over these third-party
        technologies, and they are not covered by our privacy statement.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>

    <p>The security of your personal information is important to us. Your EducatorFund account information is tied to
        your physical mobile device. It is important that you protect against unauthorized access of your account and
        information by choosing a password carefully for your device, and keeping your password and device secure at
        all times after using our services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <p>EducatorFund encrypts sensitive information (such as credit card number) using secure socket layer technology
        (SSL).&nbsp; Since EducatorFund works over text messaging, EducatorFund will never ask for sensitive
        information via text messaging.&nbsp; In cases where EducatorFund needs sensitive information (such as a credit
        card number), the App will call your device to obtain your details securely.&nbsp; EducatorFund follows
        generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during
        transmission and once EducatorFund receives it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
        electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect
        your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. EducatorFund offers optional advanced
        security settings for members,&nbsp; full-site SSL, and usage history.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>

    <p>EducatorFund will retain your information only for as long as is necessary or your account is active or as
        needed to provide you services. If you no longer want EducatorFund to use your information to provide you
        services, you may close your account. EducatorFund will retain and use your information as necessary to comply
        with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>You may inform us of any changes or requests in regards to your personal data, and in accordance with our
        obligations under local data protection law, we may update or delete your personal data accordingly.</p>

    <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>

    <p>EducatorFund reserves the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it periodically.
        We&rsquo;ll communicate changes by posting a notice on the Site or the App. If we make material changes to this
        policy you will be notified here, by email, in the version notes on the App platform, or other places
        EducatorFund deems appropriate.</p>
