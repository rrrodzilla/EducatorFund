  <h1>Terms of Use</h1>

  <p>Welcome to EducatorFund. We&rsquo;re so glad you&rsquo;re here. Make yourself comfortable and have a good time,
    but please follow our house rules.</p>

  <h2><strong>1. Accepting These Terms</strong></h2>

  <p><strong>This document and the other documents that we reference below make up our house rules, or what we
      officially call our Terms of Use (the &ldquo;Terms&rdquo; for short).</strong></p>

  <p>The Terms are a legally binding contract between you and Neyborly Company.</p>

  <p><strong>Please note that</strong> <ins><strong>Section 11. Disputes with Neyborly Company</strong></ins><strong>,
      contains an arbitration clause and class action waiver. By agreeing to the Terms, you agree to resolve all
      disputes through binding individual arbitration, which means that you waive any right to have those disputes
      decided by a judge or jury, and that you waive your right to participate in class actions, class arbitrations, or
      representative actions.</strong></p>

  <p>This contract sets out your rights and responsibilities when you use EducatorFund.com, our mobile apps, and the
    other services provided by Neyborly Company (we&rsquo;ll refer to our mobile apps and other services as our
    &ldquo;Services&rdquo;), so please read it carefully. By using any of our Services (even just browsing one of our
    websites), you&rsquo;re agreeing to the Terms. If you don&rsquo;t agree with the Terms, you may not use our
    Services. You with us? Great, read on!</p>

  <h2><strong>2. Those Other Documents We Mentioned</strong></h2>

  <p>Neyborly Company&rsquo;s Services connect people around the world, both online and offline, to sell, and buy
    unique goods and services. Here&rsquo;s a handy guide to help you understand the specific rules that are relevant
    for you, depending on how you use the Services:</p>

  <p>Our House Rules for Everyone. If you use any of our Services, you agree to these Terms, and our <a href="https://www.educatorfund.com/privacy-policy.html"><ins>Privacy
        Policy</ins></a>.</p>

  <h2><strong>3. Your Privacy</strong></h2>

  <p>We know your personal information is important to you, so it&rsquo;s important to us. Our <a href="https://www.educatorfund.com/privacy-policy.html"><ins>Privacy
        Policy</ins></a> details how your information is used when you use our Services. By using our Services, you're
    also agreeing that we can process your information in the ways set out in the Privacy Policy, so please read it <a
      href="https://www.educatorfund.com/privacy-policy.html"><ins>here</ins></a>.</p>

  <h2><strong>4. Your Account with Neyborly Company</strong></h2>

  <p>You&rsquo;ll need to create an account with EducatorFund to use some of our Services. Here are a few rules about
    accounts with EducatorFund:</p>

  <p><strong>A. You must be 18 years or older to use our Services.</strong> Minors under 18 and at least 13 years of
    age are only permitted to use our Services through an account owned by a parent or legal guardian with their
    appropriate permission and under their direct supervision. Children under 13 years are not permitted to use the
    Services. You are responsible for any and all account activity conducted by a minor on your account.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong>B. Be honest with us.</strong> Provide accurate information about yourself. It&rsquo;s not OK to use false
    information or impersonate another person or company through your account.</p>

  <p><strong>C. Choose an appropriate name.</strong> If you decide to not have your full name serve as the name
    associated with your account, you may not use language that is offensive, vulgar, or infringes someone&rsquo;s
    intellectual property rights, or otherwise violates the Terms.</p>

  <p><strong>D. You're responsible for your account.</strong> You&rsquo;re solely responsible for any activity on your
    account. If you&rsquo;re sharing an account with other people, then the person whose billing information is on the
    account will ultimately be responsible for all activity. If you&rsquo;re registering as a business entity, you
    personally guarantee that you have the authority to agree to the Terms on behalf of the business. Also, your
    accounts are not transferable.</p>

  <p><strong>E. Protect your password.</strong> As we mentioned above, you&rsquo;re solely responsible for any activity
    on your account, so it&rsquo;s important to keep your device password secure.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong>F. Let's be clear about our relationship.</strong> These Terms don't create any agency, partnership, joint
    venture, employment, or franchisee relationship between you and Neyborly Company.</p>

  <h2><strong>5. Your Content</strong></h2>

  <p>Content that you post using our Services is your content (so let&rsquo;s refer to it as &ldquo;Your
    Content&rdquo;). We don&rsquo;t make any claim to it, which includes anything you post using our Services (like
    class or event names, profile pictures, listing photos, listing descriptions, reviews, comments, videos, usernames,
    etc.).</p>

  <p><strong>A. Responsibility for Your Content.</strong> You understand that you are solely responsible for Your
    Content. You represent that you have all necessary rights to Your Content and that you&rsquo;re not infringing or
    violating any third party&rsquo;s rights by posting it.</p>

  <p><strong>B. Permission to Use Your Content</strong>. By posting Your Content through our Services, you grant
    Neybory Company a license to use it. We don&rsquo;t claim any ownership to Your Content, but we have your
    permission to use it to help Neyborly Company and it's related services (such as EducatorFund) function and grow.
    That way, we won&rsquo;t infringe any rights you have in Your Content and we can help promote your stuff.</p>

  <p><strong>C. Rights You Grant Neyborly Company.</strong> (Here&rsquo;s the legalese version of the last section). By
    posting Your Content, you grant &nbsp;Neybory Company a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable,
    sub-licensable, perpetual license to use, display, edit, modify, reproduce, distribute, store, and prepare
    derivative works of Your Content. This allows us to provide the Services and to promote Neyborly Company and it's
    related services (such as EducatorFund) , your classes and events, or the Services in general, in any formats and
    through any channels, including across any Neyborly Company Services, our partners, or third-party website or
    advertising medium. You agree not to assert any moral rights or rights of publicity against us for using Your
    Content. You also recognize our legitimate interest in using it, in accordance with the scope of this license, to
    the extent Your Content contains any personal information.</p>

  <p>That sounds like a lot, but it&rsquo;s necessary for us to keep Neyborly Company and it's related services (such
    as EducatorFund) going. Consider these examples: if you post a class listing on your EducatorFund account, first,
    we have permission to display it to buyers, and second, we can format it so it looks good to a buyer using our
    mobile app; if you post a description in English, we can translate it into French so a buyer in Paris can learn the
    story behind your class; and if you post a beautiful photo of your latest class project which EducatorFund helped
    you fund, we can feature it on our homepage, in one of our blogs or even on a billboard to help promote your class
    and Neyborly Company and it's related services (such as EducatorFund) .</p>

  <p><strong>D. Reporting Unauthorized Content.</strong> Neyborly Company has great respect for intellectual property
    rights, and is committed to following appropriate legal procedures to remove infringing content from the Services.
    If content that you own or have rights to has been posted to the Services without your permission and you want it
    removed, please contact support@educatorfund.com. If Your Content is alleged to infringe another person&rsquo;s
    intellectual property, we will take appropriate action, from disabling it if we receive proper notice, up through
    termination of your account if you are found to be a repeat infringer. We&rsquo;ll notify you if any of that
    happens.</p>

  <p><strong>E. Inappropriate, False, or Misleading Content.</strong> This should be common sense, but there are
    certain types of content we don&rsquo;t want posted on Neyborly Company&rsquo;s Services (for legal reasons or
    otherwise). You agree that you will not post any content that is abusive, threatening, defamatory, obscene, vulgar,
    or otherwise offensive or in violation of any part of our Terms. You also agree not to post any content that is
    false and misleading or uses the Services in a manner that is fraudulent or deceptive.</p>

  <h2><strong>6. Your Use of Our Services</strong></h2>

  <p><strong>License to Use Our Services.</strong> We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and
    revocable license to use our Services&mdash;subject to the Terms and the following restrictions in particular:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>A. Don&rsquo;t Use Our Services to Break the Law.</strong> You agree that you will not violate any laws
      in connection with your use of the Services. This includes any local, state, federal, and international laws that
      may apply to you. For example, it&rsquo;s your responsibility to pay any taxes your account revenue requires; you
      may not engage in fraud (including false claims or infringement notices), theft, anti-competitive conduct,
      threatening conduct, or any other unlawful acts or crimes against Neyborly Company, another EducatorFund user, or
      a third party.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>B. Pay Your Bills.</strong> You are responsible for paying all fees that you owe to Neyborly Company.
      Except as set forth below, you are also solely responsible for collecting and/or paying any applicable taxes for
      any purchases or sales you make through our Services. Your fees, bills, taxes, and how you can pay them are fully
      explained in our <a href="./fees.html"><ins>Fees &amp; Payments Policy</ins></a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>C. Don&rsquo;t Steal Our Stuff.</strong> You agree not to &ldquo;crawl,&rdquo; &ldquo;scrape,&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;spider&rdquo; any page of the Services or to reverse engineer or attempt to obtain the source code of the
      Services.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>D. Don&rsquo;t Try to Harm Our Systems.</strong> You agree not to interfere with or try to disrupt our
      Services, for example by distributing a virus or other harmful computer code.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>E. Follow Our Trademark Policy.</strong> The names &ldquo;EducatorFund,&rdquo; "Neyborly Company" and
      the other Neyborly Company marks, phrases, logos, and designs that we use in connection with our Services, are
      trademarks, service marks, or trade dress of Neyborly Company in the US and other countries.&nbsp;</li>
    <li><br></li>
    <li><strong>F. Share Your Ideas.</strong> We love your suggestions and ideas! They can help us improve your
      experience and our Services. Any unsolicited ideas or other materials you submit to Neyborly Company (not
      including Your Content or items you sell through our Services) are considered non-confidential and
      non-proprietary to you. You grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, sub-licensable,
      perpetual license to use and publish those ideas and materials for any purpose, without compensation to you.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><strong>7. Termination</strong></h2>

  <p><strong>Termination By You.</strong> We'd hate to see you go, but you may terminate your account with EducatorFund
    at any time by emailing support@educatorfund.com. &nbsp;Terminating your account will not affect the availability
    of some of Your Content that you posted through the Services prior to termination. Oh, and you&rsquo;ll still have
    to pay any outstanding bills.</p>

  <p><strong>Termination By Neyborly Company.</strong> We may terminate or suspend your account (and any related
    accounts) and your access to the Services at any time, for any reason, and without advance notice. If we do so,
    it&rsquo;s important to understand that you don&rsquo;t have a contractual or legal right to continue to use our
    Services. Neyborly Company may refuse service to anyone, at any time, for any reason.</p>

  <p>If you or Neyborly Company terminate your account, you may lose any information associated with your account,
    including Your Content.</p>

  <p><strong>We May Discontinue the Services.</strong> Neyborly Company reserves the right to change, suspend, or
    discontinue any of the Services at any time, for any reason. We will not be liable to you for the effect that any
    changes to the Services may have on you, including your income or your ability to generate revenue through the
    Services.</p>

  <p><strong>Survival.</strong> The Terms will remain in effect even after your access to the Service is terminated, or
    your use of the Service ends.</p>

  <h2><strong>8. Warranties and Limitation of Liability (or the Things You Can&rsquo;t Sue Us For)</strong></h2>

  <p><strong>Items You Purchase, Subscribe or Donate to.</strong> You understand that Neyborly Company does not
    manufacture, store, or inspect any of the items sold through our Services. We provide the venue; the items in our
    marketplaces are produced, listed, and sold directly by independent educators, so Neyborly Company cannot and does
    not make any warranties about their quality, safety, or even their legality. Any legal claim related to an item you
    purchase must be brought directly against the seller of the item. You release Neyborly Company from any claims
    related to items sold through our Services, including for defective items, misrepresentations by sellers, or items
    that caused physical injury (like product liability claims).</p>

  <p><strong>Content You Access.</strong> You may come across materials that you find offensive or inappropriate while
    using our Services. We make no representations concerning any content posted by users through the Services.
    Neyborly Company is not responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of content posted
    by users that you accessed through the Services. You release us from all liability relating to that content.</p>

  <p><strong>People You Interact With.</strong> You can use the Services to interact with other individuals, either
    online or in person. However, you understand that we do not screen users of our Services, and you release us from
    all liability relating to your interactions with other users. Please be careful and exercise caution and good
    judgment in all interactions with others, especially if you are meeting someone in person.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong>Third-Party Services.</strong> Our Services may contain links to third-party websites or services that we
    don&rsquo;t own or control (for example, links to Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest). You may also need to use a
    third party&rsquo;s product or service in order to use some of our Services (like a compatible mobile device to use
    our mobile apps). When you access these third-party services, you do so at your own risk. The third parties may
    require you to accept their own terms of use. &nbsp;Neyborly Company is not a party to those agreements; they are
    solely between you and the third party.</p>

  <p><strong>Warranties.</strong> &nbsp;Neyborly Company is dedicated to making our Services the best they can be, but
    we&rsquo;re not perfect and sometimes things can go wrong. You understand that our Services are provided &ldquo;as
    is&rdquo; and without any kind of warranty (express or implied). We are expressly disclaiming any warranties of
    title, non-infringement, merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose, as well as any warranties implied
    by a course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade.</p>

  <p>We do not guarantee that: (i) the Services will be secure or available at any particular time or location; (ii)
    any defects or errors will be corrected; (iii) the Services will be free of viruses or other harmful materials; or
    (iv) the results of using the Services will meet your expectations. You use the Services solely at your own risk.
    Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, so the above limitations may not apply to you.</p>

  <p><strong>Liability Limits.</strong> To the fullest extent permitted by law, neither &nbsp;Neyborly Company, nor our
    employees or directors shall be liable to you for any lost profits or revenues, or for any consequential,
    incidental, indirect, special, or punitive damages arising out of or in connection with the Services or these
    Terms. In no event shall &nbsp;Neyborly Company&rsquo;s aggregate liability for any damages exceed the greater of
    one hundred ($100) US Dollars or the amount you paid us in the past twelve months. Some jurisdictions do not allow
    limitations on incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you.</p>

  <h2><strong>9. Indemnification (or What Happens If You Get Us Sued)</strong></h2>

  <p>We hope this never happens, but if Neyborly Company gets sued because of something that you did, you agree to
    defend and indemnify us. That means you&rsquo;ll defend &nbsp;Neyborly Company &nbsp;(including any of our
    employees) and hold us harmless from any legal claim or demand (including reasonable attorney&rsquo;s fees) that
    arises from your actions, your use (or misuse) of our Services, your breach of the Terms, or your account&rsquo;s
    infringement of someone else&rsquo;s rights.</p>

  <p>We reserve the right to handle our legal defense however we see fit, even if you are indemnifying us, in which
    case you agree to cooperate with us so we can execute our strategy.</p>

  <h2><strong>10. Disputes with Other Users</strong></h2>

  <p>If you find yourself in a dispute with another user of &nbsp;Neyborly Company Services or a third party, we
    encourage you to contact the other party and try to resolve the dispute amicably.</p>

  <p><strong>Release of Neyborly Company.</strong> You release Neyborly Company &nbsp;from any claims, demands, and
    damages arising out of disputes with other users or parties.</p>

  <h2><strong>11. Disputes with </strong>Neyborly Company&nbsp;</h2>

  <p>If you&rsquo;re upset with us, let us know, and hopefully we can resolve your issue. But if we can&rsquo;t, then
    these rules will govern any legal dispute involving our Services:</p>

  <p><strong>A. Governing Law.</strong> The Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Washington, without regard
    to its conflict of laws rules, and the laws of the United States of America. These laws will apply no matter where
    in the world you live, but if you live outside of the United States, you may be entitled to the protection of the
    mandatory consumer protection provisions of your local consumer protection law.</p>

  <p><strong>B. Arbitration.</strong> You and Neyborly Company agree that any dispute or claim arising from or relating
    to the Terms shall be finally settled by final and binding arbitration, using the English language, administered by
    the American Arbitration Association (the &ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules")
    then in effect (those rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this section, and as of the date of
    these Terms you can find the AAA Rules <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/document_repository/Consumer_Arbitration_Rules_Web.pdf"><ins>here</ins></a>).
    <strong>Arbitration will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with those rules. Judgment on the
      arbitration award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction. Any arbitration under the Terms will take
      place on an individual basis--class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. You understand that by
      agreeing to the Terms, you and </strong>&nbsp;<strong>Neyborly Company</strong> <strong>are each waiving the
      right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action or class arbitration.</strong> Notwithstanding the
    foregoing, each party shall have the right to bring an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or
    other equitable or conservatory relief, pending a final decision by the arbitrator. You may instead assert your
    claim in &ldquo;small claims&rdquo; court, but only if your claim qualifies, your claim remains in such court, and
    your claim remains on an individual, non-representative, and non-class basis.</p>

  <p><strong>C. Costs of Arbitration.</strong> Payment for any and all reasonable AAA filing, administrative, and
    arbitrator fees will be in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules. If the value of your claim does not
    exceed $10,000, Neyborly Company will pay for the reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees associated
    with the arbitration, unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought was
    frivolous or brought for an improper purpose.</p>

  <p><strong>D. Forum.</strong> We&rsquo;re based in Seattle, Washington , so any legal action against &nbsp;Neyborly
    Company related to our Services must be filed and take place in Seattle. For all actions under the AAA Rules, the
    proceedings may be filed where your residence is, or in Seattle, Washington, and any in-person hearings will be
    conducted at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties taking into account their ability to travel
    and other pertinent circumstances.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong>E. Government Exception.</strong> If you are a government agent or entity in the United States using the
    Services in your official capacity, and you are legally unable to agree to the clauses in this section, then those
    clauses do not apply to you. In that case, the Terms and any action related to the Terms will be governed by the
    laws of the United States (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the
    extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of Washington.</p>

  <p><strong>F. Modifications.</strong> If we make any changes to this &ldquo;Disputes with &nbsp;Neyborly
    Company&rdquo; section after the date you last accepted the Terms, those changes will not apply to any claims filed
    in a legal proceeding against &nbsp;Neyborly Company &nbsp;prior to the date the changes became effective.
    &nbsp;Neyborly Company will notify you of substantive changes to the &ldquo;Disputes with Neyborly Company &rdquo;
    section at least 30 days prior to the date the change will become effective. If you do not agree to the modified
    terms, you may send &nbsp;Neyborly Company a written notification (including email) or close your account within
    those 30 days. By rejecting a modified term or permanently closing your account, you agree to arbitrate any
    disputes between you and &nbsp;Neyborly Company in accordance with the provisions of this &ldquo;Disputes with
    Neyborly Company&rdquo; section as of the date you last accepted the Terms, including any changes made prior to
    your rejection. If you reopen your closed account or create a new account, you agree to be bound by the current
    version of the Terms.</p>

  <h2><strong>12. Changes to the Terms</strong></h2>

  <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. If we believe that the changes are material, we&rsquo;ll definitely
    let you know by doing one (or more) of the following: (1) posting the changes through the Services or (2) sending
    you an email or message about the changes. That way you can decide whether you want to continue using the Services.
    Changes will be effective upon the posting of the changes. You are responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar
    with any changes. Your use of the Services following the changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

  <h2><strong>13. Some Finer Legal Points</strong></h2>

  <p>The Terms, including all of the policies that make up the Terms, supersede any other agreement between you and
    Neyborly Company regarding the Services. If any part of the Terms is found to be unenforceable, that part will be
    limited to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect. Our
    failure to enforce any part of the Terms is not a waiver of our right to later enforce that or any other part of
    the Terms. We may assign any of our rights and obligations under the Terms.</p>

  <h2><strong>14. Contact Information</strong></h2>

  <p>If you have any questions about the Terms, please email us at: legal@neybor.ly</p>
