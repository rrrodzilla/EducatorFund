    <h1>Fees &amp; Payments Policy</h1>

    <p>Educators may be charged for using some of Neyborly Company&rsquo;s services. This Fees &amp; Payments Policy
        explains your fees and taxes and how to pay them.</p>

    <p>This policy is a part of our <a href="./tos.html"><ins>Terms of Use</ins></a>. By opening an Neyborly Company or
        EducatorFund educator account, you&rsquo;re agreeing to this policy and our Terms of Use.</p>


    <h2><strong>1. Types of Fees</strong></h2>

    <p>Educators may be required to pay the following types of fees, please note that all fees are listed exclusive of
        any VAT that may apply. See the Taxes section below for further details:</p>

    <h3><br></h3>
    <h3><strong>Transaction Fees</strong></h3>

    <p>When a customer gifts or donates money towards a subscription or class you make through EducatorFund, you will
        be charged a transaction fee of 2.9% + .30 cents USD of the price paid for your item.&nbsp;</p>

    <h3><strong>Subscription Fees</strong></h3>

    <p>EducatorFund educators in good standing who incur a transfer of money into their external account will be
        charged $2 USD per active month. An active month is any month in which a transfer occurs. &nbsp;Months where no
        transfer occurs will not incur this charge.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h3><strong>Payment Processing Fees</strong></h3>

    <p>Eligible Neyborly Company accounts may use Stripe Payments to accept certain payments through Neyborly
        Company. Neyborly Company charges a payment processing fee for processing each transaction through Neyborly
        Company Payments. This fee is assessed on the total amount of the sale. Payment processing fees are deducted
        from the sale amount in your payment account. &nbsp;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h3><strong>Platform Fees</strong></h3>

    <p>Each payment transaction is subject to a 12% platform fee assessed against the total transaction amount.
        &nbsp;Platform fees are deducted from the sale amount in your payment account. &nbsp;</p>

    <h2><strong>2. Fee Avoidance</strong></h2>

    <p>Any action by an Educator to avoid paying a fee is considered fee avoidance and is strictly prohibited by
        Neyborly
        Company. This includes, for example, encouraging buyers to purchase an item in your account
        through another venue. A transaction initiated on Neyborly Company may not be completed off of Neyborly
        Company. Educators
        may not alter the item's price after a sale for the purpose of avoiding Neyborly Company transaction fees,
        misrepresent the item&rsquo;s location, or use another user's account without permission.</p>

    <h2><strong>3. Paying your Neyborly Company Fees</strong></h2>

    <p>Neyborly Company will automatically deduct all fees owed from each transaction before it posts to your Stripe
        payment account.&nbsp;</p>

    <h2><strong>5. Taxes</strong></h2>

    <p>Aside from the limited circumstances set out below, you are responsible for collecting and paying any taxes
        associated with using and making sales through Neyborly Company&rsquo;s services. Neyborly Company will issue
        1099-K forms to certain Educators in the United States to comply with IRS and state requirements.&nbsp;</p>

    <h2><strong>Listing your Classes or Projects on Neyborly Company</strong></h2>

    <p>Please remember that Neyborly Company's fees do not include any withholding taxes that might apply in your home
        country. You are required to pay Neyborly Company the full amount of our fees and may not deduct any applicable
        withholding taxes from that amount.</p>

    <p>Please also note that some countries require Neyborly Company to apply VAT on the fees that you may be charged
        in accordance with this policy, and that the fees listed in this policy are exclusive of VAT.&nbsp;</p>
