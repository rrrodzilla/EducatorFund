                    <p class="light-font mb-5">EducatorFund lets anybody gift one-time or monthly payments to
                        educators. Educators use the funds to buy supplies and educational experiences for our
                        children. Ninety-four percent of US educators already do this with their own money.
                        EducatorFund is an artificial intelligence powered SMS chat bot. Our chatbot works over text
                        messages (SMS). You text our bot and our bot texts you back. Sometimes to gather information
                        and other times to process your gift payments. Our software uses a low-fidelity interface (text
                        messages) but packs some smarts!
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="mb-3">How do I pay an educator for a class?</h4>
                    <p class="light-font mb-5">EducatorFund assigns every class a number (i.e. 1234) you will use to
                        identify it. Each teacher also receives a unique username. To contribute to a class you'll need
                        three pieces of information.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="light-font">Our contribution phone number (+1 (855) 822-0333)</li>
                        <li class="light-font">Your educator's username. For example "mathguy" or "coachjoe".</li>
                        <li class="light-font">The class number you want to contribute to.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="light-font mb-5">Text your educator's username to our contribution phone number. Send the
                        class number when EducatorFund asks for it. Then follow the instructions to make a one-time
                        payment or subscribe monthly to the class. In either case you get to decide how much you
                        contribute. (At least $5 USD)<br /><br />
                        If this is the first time you are making a contribution then you'll want to have your payment
                        details nearby. The EducatorFund chat bot will call you to get your credit or debit card
                        details. Our payment provider stores your payment details for future use. If you use
                        EducatorFund again, we'll ask you if you want to use the same card again. EducatorFund never
                        stores PCI (Payment Card Industry) data on our own servers. Our payment processor is fully PCI
                        compliant.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="mb-3">What payment methods do you accept?</h4>
                    <p class="light-font mb-5">Users in the United States can accept Visa, Mastercard, American
                        Express, Discover, JCB, Diners Club and China UnionPay credit and debit cards from people
                        anywhere in the world.</p>
                    <h4 class="mb-3">What kinds of things can educators use funds for?</h4>
                    <p class="light-font mb-5">Anything. EducatorFund aims to replace the money educators currently pay
                        out-of-pocket. EducatorFund is not a non-profit donation platform. EducatorFund reports gifts
                        provided to educators as 1099 income. EducatorFund does not attempt to restrict educator
                        purchases to curated vendors. We trust educators to use the funds provided by parents, family
                        and others for their students. They are already doing it with their own money today.</p>
                    <h4 class="mb-3">How much can I give?</h4>
                    <p class="light-font mb-5">Contributors can give as much as $999,999 USD and as little as $5 USD as
                        either a one-time gift or as an on-going subscription. Contact us for any amounts greater than
                        that range.</p>
                    <h4 class="mb-3">Is EducatorFund a non-profit?</h4>
                    <p class="light-font mb-5">No. EducatorFund is created, owned and operated by Neyborly Company, a
                        private technology firm in Seattle, Washington. Neyborly Company relies on revenue from
                        platform and credit card fees to help us pay our technology partners, provide quality customer
                        support, process transfers, and pay for other costs associated with providing our service. Fees
                        are deducted from educator revenues at the time of transfer.</p>

                    <h4 class="mb-3">What commands does the EducatorFund bot understand?</h4>
                    <p class="light-font mb-5"> EducatorFund will let you know what you can reply with by highlighting
                        commands in ALL CAPS. For example, if EducatorFund replies with:


                        "You can support a NEW class or MANAGE your subscriptions." Then you can respond with either
                        NEW or MANAGE

                        depending on what you want to do. Other times EducatorFund will tell you if it is expecting a
                        number. Occasionally EducatorFund will ask you a yes or no question, and you can reply with
                        either a yes or no.

                        <strong>Your replies to EducatorFund do not have to be in all caps.</strong>

                    <h4 class="mb-3">Which app stores are you in?</h4>
                    <p class="light-font mb-5">None. Since EducatorFund works over text messaging, there are no apps to
                        install. Nothing to download. Nothing to install. You're welcome. ;-)</p>
                    <h4 class="mb-3">Which browsers are supported?</h4>
                    <p class="light-font mb-5">None. Since EducatorFund works over text messaging, there are no
                        websites to visit (unless you come here for information). No URLs to bookmark. Nothing to
                        install. You're welcome. ;-)</p>
                    <h4 class="mb-3">When can I cancel my subscriptions?</h4>
                    <p class="light-font mb-5">Subscriptions to classes can be cancelled at any time by texting HELLO
                        to EducatorFund and replying with option 2. EducatorFund will gather some information from you
                        to cancel your subscription immediately.</p>
                    <h4 class="mb-3">Who is an educator?</h4>
                    <p class="light-font mb-5">Educators can be anyone we send our children to for education. Teachers
                        in public or private schools, pre-school through college are obvious candidates. But coaches
                        for youth sports programs can use EducatorFund as well. Little leagues, soccer, football and
                        swimming coaches need easy ways to receive funds. Parent-teacher associations can receive
                        monthly contributions by setting up subscriptions. This is far more powerful than a bake sale.
                        Community youth centers can do the same.</p>
                    <h4 class="mb-3">What counts as a class?</h4>
                    <p class="light-font mb-5">A class can be anything that makes sense for an educator to collect
                        funds for. Educators can create as many classes to fund as they desire. One educator might have
                        a class for a specific classroom (Introduction to Art - 5th Period). Or she might create a
                        single class for her entire student population (Art - 2018/2019 school year). One educator
                        might create a class for her team (Little Sharks Community Soccer Team). Another might be a
                        treasurer for a parent teacher association to create a class for the entire organization (Our
                        Middle School PTA Fund).</p>
                    <h4 class="mb-3">Why text messaging? Why isn't there an app for this?</h4>
                    <p class="light-font mb-5">We believe in low fidelity user interfaces backed by super-smart
                        software. This allows the most amount of people to enjoy our platform. Did you know that only
                        77% of the US population has a smart phone of any kind? Coincidentally, only 77% of the US
                        population has broadband internet access. Much of this population resides in 35 of our most
                        affluent cities. 95% of the US population has a mobile phone that sends and receives text
                        messages. This means our platform is accessible to over 70 million people who wouldn't have
                        been able to use it if it were an app. No hardware to install. No software to download. Using
                        EducatorFund couldn't be easier.</p>
                    <h4 class="mb-3">Who is your payment processor?</h4>
                    <p class="light-font mb-5">We use <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> to make sure educators
                        get paid on time and keep your personal and payment details secure. &nbsp;&nbsp;Millions of
                        companies trust Stripe to send payments to users around the world. &nbsp;Companies like
                        Facebook, Amazon, Lyft and Shopify use Stripe every day. &nbsp;Here are some <a href="https://stripe.com/us/customers#mobile-commerce">more</a>.</p>
                    <h4 class="mb-3">How else can I help?</h4>
                    <p class="light-font mb-5">
                        Even if you are unable to contribute money to your child's class you can still help by sharing
                        the donation information with friends and family who may want to take part. You can also share
                        EducatorFund with any educators in your life who need help with out-of-pocket costs.</p>
